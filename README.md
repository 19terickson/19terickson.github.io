## Projects
This portfolio contains various projects that I've worked on. Each project has its own directory with a detailed README explaining the project's purpose, technology stack, challenges faced, and learning outcomes.

### AlgoGauge
**Description:** AlgoGauge is an innovative web application designed to allow users to interactively test and measure the efficiency of various sorting algorithms. It incorporates a real-time queuing system, providing a platform where users can submit algorithm tasks and receive immediate feedback upon completion.

**Technologies Used:** Javascript, HTML, MERN-Stack Development (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

### Interface Previews

#### Home Page

*The Home Page introduces users to the platform and guides them towards algorithm selection and testing.*

#### Metrics Page

*The Metrics Page displays user performance metrics and results.*

#### Queue System
![Algo Gauge Queue System](AlgoGauge/AlgoGauge-Screenshots/AlgoQueue.gif)

*In my contribution to the Algo Gauge project, I focused extensively on developing the Queue Modal (shown above). This feature is pivotal to the user experience, as it dynamically shows each user's position in the queue, updating in real-time. I implemented the logic to ensure that once a user's algorithm task is processed, their entry is promptly removed from the queue, maintaining the system's efficiency and user engagement.*

### Code Snippets I Developed

#### Queue Management

*Pictured here is a key segment of the queue management system, which I was responsible for on the server side. This code orchestrates the queuing logic, including the addition of tasks to the queue and their removal upon completion. It's designed to handle high volumes of user requests with reliability and speed.*

#### User Position Tracking
![User Position Tracking Code](AlgoGauge/AlgoGauge-Screenshots/QueuePosition.png)

*This code snippet highlights the real-time user position tracking feature that I engineered. It ensures that users are kept informed of their current position in the queue. The functionality includes not just tracking but also updating user status and cleaning up the queue by deleting entries post-execution to optimize system performance.*

### Utah Parks Explorer
**Description:** Utah Parks Explorer is a website that offers extensive information about Utah's national parks: Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Arches, and Canyonlands. This website will not only detail the unique features of each park but also provide practical information such as maps, trails, accommodations, and visitor guidelines.

**Technologies Used:** Javascript, HTML, Python, Python Django
